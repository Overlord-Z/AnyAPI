This folder contains deprecated files that were replaced during the modularization refactoring.

## Files Archived

### `endpoint-tester-original.js` (3,307 lines)
- Original monolithic endpoint-tester.js file
- Contained runtime errors and was too large to maintain
- Replaced with modular structure in `core/` and `ui/` directories

### `endpoint-tester-broken.js` 
- Intermediate version with runtime errors
- Had "loadRequestHistory is not a function" error

### `endpoint-tester-clean.js`
- Clean version but still monolithic
- Was used as reference for creating the final modular version

## Replacement Structure

The monolithic files were replaced with:
- `core/endpoint-tester.js` (428 lines) - Core business logic
- `core/history-manager.js` - Request history management  
- `core/response-viewer.js` - Response display functionality

## Benefits of Modularization

✅ **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify
✅ **DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication
✅ **ES6 Modules**: Proper import/export structure
✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between core logic and UI manipulation
✅ **Performance**: Dynamic loading system prevents blocking
✅ **Error Handling**: Better error isolation and handling
