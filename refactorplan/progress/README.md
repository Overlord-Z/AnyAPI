# Profile Create Wizard Progress Log (2025-05-30)

## Recent Progress
- Implemented step 4 (review and create) in the wizard, including:
  - Review UI summarizing all fields.
  - 'Back' and 'Create Profile' buttons.
  - Backend integration with `apiClient.createProfile`.
  - Success/error notification and modal close on success.
- Ensured DRY, modular code and consistent event handling.

## Issues/Blockers
- Header preview in step 2 does not update on all relevant field changes (e.g., API key, token, Meraki style).
- Step 4 review does not show the actual merged headers (default + auth) as they will be sent.
- SecretStore status and secret field values are not always reflected correctly in the UI.
- Backend returns 500 errors and 'Profile name is required' even when a name is provided. Suspect payload/field mapping issue.

## Next Steps
- Fix header preview logic in step 2 to update on all relevant field changes.
- In step 4, show the actual headers that will be sent (merged default + auth headers, with secrets masked).
- Audit secret handling and SecretStore status display for accuracy and security.
- Debug backend payload/validation issues (log payload, check field names, ensure required fields).
- Improve error messages and validation feedback for users.
